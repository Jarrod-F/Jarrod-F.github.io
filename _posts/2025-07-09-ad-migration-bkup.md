## Introduction: The Importance of Domain Controller Backups

The Domain Controller (DC) is the heart of a Windows network, acting as the central authentication and identity source. It stores all user and computer accounts, security policies, and other essential Active Directory objects. The loss of a DC can be catastrophic, preventing users from logging in and potentially causing a complete network outage.

> **System State and FSMO Roles**
>
> Unlike a simple file backup, a DC backup must capture the **system state**, which includes the Active Directory database (NTDS.dit), SYSVOL folder, registry, and other critical components. This is essential for properly restoring the domain, especially the Flexible Single Master Operation (FSMO) roles that are handled by a single DC.

This comprehensive backup serves as a preparatory safety measure for migrating the existing AD DC VM from its current resource-limited Proxmox host to a more powerful, dedicated one.

## Pre-Backup Documentation and Health Check

Before any backup or migration, it's vital to document the current state of the VM and verify the health of Active Directory.

### 1. Gathering Network Configuration

Documenting network details beforehand is critical for successful post-migration verification. After logging into the Windows Server VM, the `ipconfig /all` command was executed in an elevated PowerShell prompt.

```powershell
ipconfig /all
```

![Network Configuration Output](/assets/img/posts/ad-migration-bkup/ad-migration-bkup-img1.jpg)
*Figure 1: Output of `ipconfig /all` showing critical network configuration for migration.*

Recording the IPv4 Address (`192.168.30.190`), Subnet Mask (`255.255.255.224`), Default Gateway (`192.168.30.161`), and DNS Servers (`127.0.0.1`) establishes a baseline to verify against after the migration is complete.

### 2. Checking Active Directory Health

Migrating a DC with pre-existing issues can lead to persistent problems. The `dcdiag` tool is indispensable for performing a series of health checks. First, a check on DNS health was performed using `dcdiag /test:dns`.

![DNS Health Check Results](/assets/img/posts/ad-migration-bkup/ad-migration-bkup-img2.jpg)
*Figure 2: Successful DNS health check results from the `dcdiag` tool.*

A successful result, indicated by "passed test DNS," signified that the DC's DNS services were functioning correctly. Next, a comprehensive diagnostic test was performed on all DC components with `dcdiag /c`.

![Comprehensive dcdiag Output](/assets/img/posts/ad-migration-bkup/ad-migration-bkup-img3.jpg)
*Figure 3: Comprehensive `dcdiag` output highlighting warnings for future resolution.*

While many core tests passed, the output revealed a `SystemLog` failure and several warnings related to DNS name resolution and the NTP Client. For the purpose of this guide, these diagnostics document the current state. The focus remains on securing a reliable backup, with a plan to address these non-critical warnings after the migration.

> **A Note on Triage in IT**
>
> This approach demonstrates a realistic understanding of managing production-like environments, where immediate problem resolution must often be balanced with completing critical, scheduled tasks like a migration.

### 3. Documenting Current Performance Metrics

To establish a performance baseline, the VM's resource allocation and the host's hardware specifications were documented. This allows for a direct comparison after migrating to the new, more powerful Dell Precision 7710 hardware.

* **VM Resource Allocation:** In the Proxmox UI, the VM's **Hardware** tab was reviewed.
* **Current Performance:** The CPU and memory usage were monitored from the VM's **Summary** tab.

![Proxmox UI Performance Summary](/assets/img/posts/ad-migration-bkup/ad-migration-bkup-img4.jpg)
*Figure 4: Proxmox UI showing VM hardware allocation and summary metrics.*

**Host Hardware Specs:** Accessed via <kbd>Datacenter â†’ pve â†’ Shell</kbd> in the Proxmox UI. The following commands were executed:

```bash
# Get CPU model
cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "model name" | head -1

# Get total memory
free -h
```

*Figure 5: Proxmox shell output showing host hardware specifications.*

This documentation provides a clear "before" snapshot for performance benchmarking once the migration is complete.

### 4. Documenting Network Architecture

To complete the pre-migration snapshot, the current network routing table was captured from the Windows Server VM.

```powershell
route print
```

![Windows Routing Table](/assets/img/posts/ad-migration-bkup/ad-migration-bkup-img6.jpg)
*Figure 6: The output of `route print`, documenting the VM's current network routes.*

To complement the routing table, the current network topology was visualized using Packet Tracer. This diagram reflects how the VM interfaces with other lab components, including VLAN segmentation and gateway routing.

## Choosing the Backup Method (Proxmox VZDump)

When backing up a VM, especially a DC, there are two main approaches:

* **Hypervisor-level backups (e.g., Proxmox `vzdump`):** Captures the entire VM state, including virtual disks and configuration.
* **In-guest backups (e.g., Windows Server Backup):** Runs inside the OS to back up specific files or the system state.

> **Tip: Use `vzdump` for Proxmox Migrations**
>
> For migrating a VM between Proxmox hosts, `vzdump` is the preferred method. It creates a comprehensive, self-contained backup file that can be easily restored to a new Proxmox environment, streamlining the transition.

## Migration Risk Assessment and Mitigation

In an enterprise environment, a risk assessment is crucial. To gain hands-on experience with ITSM best practices, a plan was created for this home lab migration.

### 1. Downtime Planning

The following table estimates the downtime window for the entire migration process.

| Migration Phase                       | Estimated Duration (HH:MM) | Notes                                     |
| :------------------------------------ | :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| Current VM Shutdown & Backup Creation | 00:30 - 01:00              | Graceful shutdown and `vzdump` backup.    |
| Backup Transfer to Main PC            | 00:15 - 00:30              | Depends on network speed and file size.   |
| New Proxmox Host Installation         | 01:00 - 02:00              | OS installation and basic configuration.  |
| VM Restoration to New Host            | 00:30 - 01:00              | Importing the VM from the backup file.    |
| Post-Migration Verification & Config  | 00:30 - 01:00              | Testing VM functionality and AD services. |
| **TOTAL ESTIMATED DOWNTIME WINDOW**   | **02:45 - 05:30**          | Actual user impact begins at VM shutdown. |

### 2. Rollback Strategy

A clear rollback strategy was developed. The existing VM on the original host would be kept powered on and functional until the new DC on the new hardware was fully verified. If the migration failed, the new VM would be powered off, and operations would continue on the original host, ensuring no lasting downtime.

---

## Performing the Proxmox VZDump Backup

The following steps were performed to create the backup within the Proxmox environment.

### 1. Pre-Backup Check: Confirming Sufficient Local Storage

From the Proxmox host shell, it was confirmed that there was sufficient free space for the backup file using `df -h`.

![Checking local storage space](/assets/img/posts/ad-migration-bkup/ad-migration-bkup-img8.jpg)
*Figure 8: Proxmox shell output showing using `df -h` to confirm available disk space on the Proxmox host.*

### 2. Navigating to the Backup Interface

In the Proxmox UI, the VM (`101 (MS-Server-22)`) was selected, and the **Backup** tab was opened.

### 3. Configuring the Backup Task

The <kbd>Backup now</kbd> button was clicked, and the task was configured with these key settings:
* **Storage:** `local`
* **Mode:** `snapshot` (Ensures data consistency for a running VM)
* **Compression:** `ZSTD` (A good balance of speed and compression ratio)

![Configuring the vzdump backup job](/assets/img/posts/ad-migration-bkup/ad-migration-bkup-img9.jpg)
*Figure 9: Configuring the `vzdump` backup job in the Proxmox UI.*

### 4. Monitoring and Verifying the Backup

The task was monitored in the UI viewer, and it was confirmed that it completed with an "INFO: Backup finished successfully" message.

![Successful backup task completion](/assets/img/posts/ad-migration-bkup/ad-migration-bkup-img10.jpg)
*Figure 10: Task viewer showing the successful completion of the backup job (time-lapsed).*

The new `.vma.zst` file was then confirmed to be present in the `local` storage's **Backups** tab and by running `ls -lah /var/lib/vz/dump/` in the shell.

## Backup Integrity and Verification

Verifying the backup file's integrity is a non-negotiable step.

### 1. Generate Checksum for Transfer Verification

In the Proxmox shell, the dump directory was accessed and a SHA256 checksum was generated, saving the output to a text file. This checksum is used to verify the file after transferring it over the network.

```bash
cd /var/lib/vz/dump/
sha256sum vzdump-qemu-101-*.vma.zst > "backup_checksum_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt"
```

### 2. Test Compression Integrity

The `zstd` command was used to test the integrity of the compressed archive itself. An exit code of `0` confirms the file is not corrupted.

```bash
zstd -t vzdump-qemu-101-*.vma.zst
echo "Exit code: $?"
```

![Verifying backup integrity with zstd](/assets/img/posts/ad-migration-bkup/ad-migration-bkup-img11.jpg)
*Figure 11: A successful `zstd` integrity test returning an exit code of 0.*

> **Tip: The Value of Verification**
>
> The `zstd -t` command is the most direct way to confirm a backup file is not corrupted. The checksum is critical for verifying the file's integrity *after* it has been transferred across the network, allowing for a direct comparison between the source and destination files.
{: .prompt-tip}

## Post-Backup Steps and Next Phase

With a verified backup secured, the final preparatory steps could be completed.

### 1. Transferring Backup for Secure Storage

> **Warning: No UI Download Button**
>
> The Proxmox web UI does not provide a native "Download" button for VM backups. File transfers must be handled with command-line tools like `scp` for efficiency and reliability.
{: .prompt-warning}

From a main PC's PowerShell, `scp` was used to pull both the backup file and its corresponding checksum file from the Proxmox host.

```powershell
# Create a local directory for the backup
New-Item -Path "C:\Proxmox\Backups" -ItemType Directory -Force

# Securely copy the backup file from the Proxmox host
scp root@192.168.30.189:/var/lib/vz/dump/vzdump-qemu-101-*.vma.zst C:\Proxmox\Backups\

# Securely copy the checksum file
scp root@192.168.30.189:/var/lib/vz/dump/backup_checksum_*.txt C:\Proxmox\Backups\
```

![Transferring backup file with SCP](/assets/img/posts/ad-migration-bkup/ad-migration-bkup-img12.jpg)
*Figure 12: Using SCP in PowerShell to transfer the backup file from the Proxmox host.*

### 2. Verifying the Transferred File

After the transfer, the checksum of the local file was calculated and compared to the content of the checksum text file. An identical match confirmed a successful, corruption-free transfer.

### 3. Creating an External Backup

Following the **3-2-1 backup rule**, an additional copy of the backup file was created on an external USB drive. This offline copy serves as the primary source for the upcoming migration and provides robust disaster recovery protection.
