{: .prompt-info}

## Introduction

The migration to enterprise-grade hardware represented a critical infrastructure upgrade for the home lab environment. The Dell Precision 7710 workstation provided the computational resources necessary to support multiple concurrent virtual machines while maintaining performance standards suitable for enterprise service simulation.

This guide documents the installation of Proxmox VE 9.0.3 on the Dell Precision 7710, leveraging the established network infrastructure to implement proper static IP configuration during the initial setup process. Unlike previous installations on resource-constrained hardware, this deployment emphasized capacity planning and enterprise-grade configuration practices.

## Hardware Assessment and Preparation

### Target Hardware Specifications

The Dell Precision 7710 represented a substantial upgrade from the previous Proxmox host:

| Component | Dell Precision 7710 | Previous Host (Reference) |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Processor | Intel i7-6920HQ (4C/8T, 2.9-3.8GHz) | Intel i3-2350M (2C/4T, 2.3GHz) |
| Memory | 32GB DDR4 | 7.7GB DDR3 |

| Form Factor | Mobile Workstation | Laptop |
| Virtualization | VT-x, VT-d supported | VT-x supported |

*Hardware comparison showing 4.2x memory increase and 2x core count improvement*

### Pre-Installation Hardware Verification

Before beginning the Proxmox installation, several hardware assessments were performed:

1. **Memory Configuration Verification:**
   - Confirmed 32GB DDR4 installation across available DIMM slots
   - Verified memory recognition in BIOS/UEFI interface
   - Documented maximum supported capacity for future expansion planning

2. **Storage Assessment:**
   - Confirmed recognition of 1TB NVMe SSD installation in BIOS/UEFI
   - Verified NVMe recognition and boot priority in BIOS/UEFI
   - Assessed storage capacity requirements for multiple VM deployments

3. **Network Interface Verification:**
   - Confirmed Gigabit Ethernet interface functionality
   - Tested physical connectivity to Cudy GS1016E managed switch
   - Verified cable integrity and port assignment (Port 5 - VLAN 30)

## Proxmox VE Installation Process

### Installation Media Preparation

The Proxmox VE 8.x ISO was downloaded from the official Proxmox website and prepared using Rufus utility. For detailed steps on creating the bootable USB drive, including the critical DD Image mode selection, reference the [original Proxmox installation guide](/posts/proxmox-hypervisor#creating-bootable-usb).

> This guide uses Proxmox VE 9.0, the latest stable release at the time of writing. The Rufus workflow remains consistent across recent versions (8.x and 9.x), so these steps apply broadly. **Note:** Newer Proxmox ISOs may not trigger the DD Image mode prompt in Rufusâ€”this is expected behavior. Rufus will automatically apply DD mode when required, and the write process remains valid for installation.
{: .prompt-tip}


> **Important:** If prompted, ensure DD Image mode is selected in Rufus when creating Proxmox installation media. This is especially critical on Windows systems to avoid installation failures.
{: .prompt-warning}


### UEFI Configuration

The Dell Precision 7710 UEFI was configured to optimize virtualization performance:

1. **Virtualization Technology Settings:**
   - Intel Virtualization Technology: Enabled
   - VT for Direct I/O: Enabled (for hardware passthrough capabilities)

2. **Boot Configuration:**
   - UEFI boot mode confirmed
   - Secure Boot disabled for Proxmox compatibility
   - Windows Boot Manager: Disabled (to prevent conflicts)
   - UEFI: PC711 NVMe (original drive): Disabled temporarily
   - USB boot priority configured for installation media

> **Security Note:** Secure Boot was disabled for Proxmox VE compatibility. Unlike Windows systems, Proxmox does not support Secure Boot and will fail to boot if re-enabled. This configuration is correct and should remain disabled for proper hypervisor operation. In enterprise environments, consider implementing additional security measures such as LUKS disk encryption and strong authentication policies to maintain security standards without Secure Boot.

### Network Configuration During Installation

Despite the established network infrastructure, the Proxmox installer did not automatically detect the correct network settings. This behavior is common in more complex environments utilizing VLANs, where tagged traffic and switch port configurations can prevent the installer from communicating with devices outside the default network. Although Proxmox can typically detect active Ethernet interfaces when connected to a live network, VLAN segmentation often requires manual configuration. As a result, static IP assignment was necessary during installation to ensure the Proxmox host was properly integrated into the designated VLAN.


![Network Configuration Screen](/assets/img/posts/proxmox-dell-install/proxmox-dell-img3.jpg)
*Figure 3: Management network configuration with static IP assignment*

**Network Settings Applied:**
- **IP Address:** 192.168.30.162/27 (VLAN 30 - transitioning to Server VLAN)
- **Gateway:** 192.168.30.161 (TP-Link Er605 router interface for VLAN 30)
- **DNS Server:** 9.9.9.9 (Quad9 DNS used instead of ISP gateway for enhanced privacy and threat blocking)
- **Hostname:** pve-precision7710.homelab.lan

> **Note:** The static IP assignment uses VLAN 30 on switch Port 5. This VLAN will be transitioned from Tech Support to Server infrastructure use, with VLAN 60 becoming the new Tech Support VLAN in subsequent guides. Once pfSense is deployed, DNS resolution will be handled by pfSense at the gateway address.
{: .prompt-info}

## Final Installation Summary & Disk Warning

Before clicking **Install**, Proxmox presents a summary screen displaying all selected configuration optionsâ€”including target disk, hostname, IP settings, and root credentials. Itâ€™s critical to review this screen carefully, especially the disk selection.

>**Warning:** Proceeding with installation will erase and format the selected disk. All existing dataâ€”including previous operating systemsâ€”will be permanently lost. Double-check that the correct drive is selected before continuing.
{: .prompt-warning}

Once confirmed, clicking **Install** begins the partitioning and setup process. This step finalizes the base system and prepares the host for post-install configuration.

## Post-Installation Configuration

### Initial System Access and Verification

Following the successful installation and automatic reboot, the system presented a login prompt on the Dell Precision 7710 console:

1. **Console Login:**
   - Username: `root` (default administrative account)
   - Password: [Password configured during installation process]

2. **Web Interface URL Display:**
   - Upon successful console login, the Proxmox web interface URL was displayed at the top of the terminal
   - Access URL: `https://192.168.30.162:8006`

3. **Web Interface Access:**
   - Navigated to the displayed URL in web browser
   - Login credentials: Same root username and password from console login

> **Tip:** If browser security warnings prevent access to the Proxmox web interface, add the URL to your browser's HTTPS certificate exception list. This is expected behavior since Proxmox uses self-signed certificates by default.

### System Optimization Notes

The upgraded hardware configuration provided optimal performance characteristics:

> **Storage Performance:** The 1TB NVMe SSD installation completed in Guide 1 provided substantial I/O performance improvements over traditional storage, enabling faster VM deployment and reduced boot times.
{: .prompt-info}

> **Memory Allocation:** With 32GB total capacity, initial VM deployments will be sized conservatively (4-6GB per VM) with monitoring for optimal resource distribution.
{: .prompt-info}

### Secondary Storage Configuration for System Backup

The following shell commands were used to identify the correct NVMe device, erase any existing filesystem signatures, and format it for dedicated backup use. After confirming the successful mount, the disk management interface was accessed via the Proxmox web GUI to visually verify the configuration: <kbd>Datacenter</kbd> â†’ <kbd>pve</kbd> â†’ <kbd>Disks</kbd>

> **Tip:** ALways use `lsblk` output to confirm device names before proceeding. NVMe devices may appear in different orders depending on installation sequence and hardware detection.
{: .prompt-tip}

```bash
# Identify available storage devices
lsblk

# Verify secondary NVMe device recognition
fdisk -l | grep nvme

# Initialize the secondary drive for backup use
wipefs -a /dev/nvme0n1

# Create GPT partition table
parted /dev/nvme0n1 mklabel gpt

# Create primary partition using full capacity
parted /dev/nvme0n1 mkpart primary ext4 0% 100%

# Format partition with ext4 filesystem
mkfs.ext4 -L "proxmox-backup" /dev/nvme0n1p1

# Create mount point for backup storage
mkdir -p /mnt/backup-storage

# Add permanent mount entry
echo "/dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/backup-storage ext4 defaults 0 2" >> /etc/fstab

# Mount the backup storage
mount -a

# Verify successful mount
df -h | grep backup-storage
```

*Figure 9: Secondary NVMe storage configuration showing dedicated backup partition*

**Storage Architecture Benefits:**
- **Dedicated Backup Storage:** 238.5GB capacity reserved exclusively for system backups
- **Performance Isolation:** NVMe performance characteristics maintained for backup operations
- **Recovery Resilience:** Separate physical storage reduces single-point-of-failure risk
- **Capacity Planning:** Adequate space for multiple Proxmox system snapshots and VM exports

This backup storage configuration established the foundation for implementing comprehensive system protection before proceeding with virtual machine deployments.

## Integration Preparation for pfSense Deployment

### Network Architecture Planning

The Proxmox installation established the foundation for implementing pfSense as the primary firewall and router in Guide 3:

**Planned Network Transition:**
- Current: Direct connection to TP-Link Er605 router
- Future: pfSense VM handling routing with Er605 in bridge mode
- VLAN management transition from hardware switch to pfSense virtual interfaces

### VM Resource Allocation Strategy

Based on the hardware capacity assessment, initial resource allocation was planned:

| Service | Planned vCPUs | Memory (GB) | Storage (GB) | Priority |
|---------|---------------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| pfSense | 2 | 4 | 20 | Critical |
| Windows Server AD | 4 | 8 | 60 | High |
| Azure AD Connect | 2 | 4 | 40 | Medium |
| Future Services | 4 | 16 | 100+ | Variable |

*Planned VM resource allocation maintaining 25% host resource reservation*

## Key Learnings and Takeaways

The installation of Proxmox VE on the Dell Precision 7710 demonstrated several important concepts for enterprise virtualization deployment:

**Infrastructure Scaling Benefits:** The hardware upgrade from 7.7GB to 32GB memory and dual-core to quad-core processing provided the computational foundation necessary for realistic enterprise service simulation. This capacity increase enabled concurrent operation of multiple Windows Server instances with realistic resource allocation.

**Network Integration Practices:** Unlike previous installations requiring post-deployment network configuration, having established network infrastructure allowed for proper static IP assignment during installation. This approach aligns with enterprise deployment practices where network parameters are predetermined and configured systematically.

**Capacity Planning Methodology:** The baseline performance documentation established measurable metrics for evaluating system performance as VM workloads were added. This approach demonstrated proactive monitoring practices essential for production environment management.

**Storage Architecture Planning:** The implementation of dedicated backup storage on secondary NVMe demonstrated enterprise-grade storage separation principles. This approach provided both performance benefits and reduced risk through hardware redundancy, essential for production virtualization environments.

**Enterprise Hardware Advantages:** The Dell Precision 7710's workstation-grade components, including support for Intel VT-d and substantial memory capacity, provided capabilities that consumer laptops could not match. These features enabled advanced virtualization scenarios including potential hardware passthrough configurations.

The successful Proxmox installation established a robust foundation for the remaining migration series guides, particularly the pfSense firewall deployment and Active Directory domain controller migration planned for subsequent phases.
